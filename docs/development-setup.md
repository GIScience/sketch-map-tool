# Development Setup

## Requirements

- Python: `^3.10`
- Poetry: `1.2`
- Node: `>=14`
- Redis: `^7.0`
- Postgres: `^15.0`
- zbar
  - Mac OS X: `brew install zbar`
  - Debian derivatives: `sudo apt-get install libzbar0`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install zbar-devel`
  - Windows: DLLs are included with the Windows Python wheels
- GDAL: `>=3.4.1, <3.5`

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for packaging and dependencies management. Please make sure it is installed on your system.
[ZBar](https://zbar.sourceforge.net/) is used to detect and decode QR-Codes and need to be installed on the system as well.

## Installation

### Python Package

```bash
# Git clone repository
# these versions have to be fixed for now, since poetry and (py)gdal packages can't work together
poetry run pip install numpy==1.23.5
poetry run pip install pygdal==3.4.1.10
poetry install
poetry shell  # Spawns a shell within the virtual environment
pre-commit install  # Install pre-commit hooks
npm install # Install local versions of esbuild, eslint and stylelint to build and check JS and CSS
# Hack away
```

### Celery Backend (Postgres) and Brocker (Redis)

```bash
docker run --name redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis
docker run --name postgres -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=smt -e POSTGRES_USER=smt postgres
```

## Usage

```bash
celery --app sketch_map_tool.tasks worker --loglevel=INFO
flask --app sketch_map_tool/app.py --debug run
# Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## Testing

To run all unit tests, run this command in the project path:
```bash
pytest tests/unit
```

## JS and CSS

For the individual html pages the js and css code should be developed in `client-src/**` as 
ES6 modules. 

To use the code in the HTML Templates it must be build (bundled). The bundler 
([esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)) will write the result to `static/bundles/**` 
such that it will be provided by Flask to the web and can be referenced from the HTML Templates.

If you want to add new code for additional HTML pages add entry-points in the build script 
[esbuild.js](../esbuild.js)

Bundle the code with:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Project Setup for PyCharm

If you like to develop using an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), you can use the PyCharm Run Configurations instead of running Python manually.

1. Use the [Poetry builtin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/poetry.html) to create the virtual environment.
2. If PyCharm asks, let it allow to install the npm and poetry/python packages.
3. Run `pre-commit install` in the PyCharm terminal (see above).
4. Add different configurations:
   1. Docker Image Configuration:
      * Image ID: `redis`
      * Container name: `redis`
      * Bind ports: `6379:6379`
   2. Docker Image Configuration:
      * Image ID: `postgres`
      * Container name: `postgres`
      * Bind ports: `5432:5432`
   3. Flask server:
      * Target type: Script path
      * Target: `project_path/sketch_map_tool/routes.py`
   4. Python:
      * Module name: `celery`
      * Parameters: `-A sketch_map_tool.tasks worker`
      * Working directory: `project_path`
      * Before launch: Run Another Configuration for both Docker Image Configurations
   5. Python tests â€” pytest:
      * Script path: `project_path/tests/unit`
      * Working Directory: `project_path`
5. For development: Run or Debug Celery and Flask Configurations
