# Configuration

The Sketch Map Tool can be configured using a configuration file.

## Configuration File

The default path of the configuration file is `config/config.toml`.
A sample configuration file can be found in the same directory: `config/sample.config.toml`.
All configuration files in this directory (`config`) will be ignored by Git.
To change the default configuration file path set the environment variable `SMT_CONFIG` to the desired path.

To create a new configuration file simply copy the sample configuration file and change the values.

```bash
cp config/sample.config.toml config/config.toml
```

## Default Configuration

For a list of all configuration variables and their default values please take a look at [config.py](sketch_map_tool/config.py).

## Required Configuration

All lot of configuration values come with defaults. Required configuration values are:
- `neptune_api_token`

### neptune.ai

Ask the team to get an invite the Sketch Map Tool project on neptuine.ai.

To get the API key go to "Project Metadata" and copy the key from the example code.

## Configuration for Docker Compose

For running the services using Docker Compose set broker URL and result backend to:

```toml
broker-url = "redis://redis:6379"
result-backend = "db+postgresql://smt:smt@postgres:5432"
```

## Misc

### ArcGIS/ESRI API Key

To retrieve up-to-date attribution an ArcGIS/ESRI API key is needed.
For local development you do not need one.
To get an ArcGIS/ESRI API key sign-up for [ArcGIS Location Platform](https://location.arcgis.com/sign-up/)
and follow [this tutorial](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/security-and-authentication/api-key-authentication/tutorials/create-an-api-key/).

Notes:
1. During registration enter your username into the "Your portal URL" and "Your portal display name" fields (not `heigit`).
2. During API key generation keep the referrer field empty.
