    {{ _('The Sketch Map Tool was used as a means to capture the local
    perception of the area around the Occhito dam by identifying
    environmentally, culturally or socially signiﬁcant landmarks as perceived by
    the local community.') }}

  <h2>{{ _('The Project') }}</h2>

    Italy that is mostly mountainous and only sparsely populated.') }}
  </p>

  <p>
    {{ _('In the late 1950s, an artiﬁcial dam was built in this area to form the
    Lake Occhito. The area is included in the protected areas of the Natura 2000
    network <a href="#2">[2]</a>, with the vegetation surrounding the lake providing habitats
    for several protected species. However, the dam has altered the local
    environment. The instability of the new waterscape has caused frequent
    ﬂooding. In addition, the agricultural system has been profoundly changed
    and the local traditional pastoral activities have almost completely
    disappeared.') }}

  <p>
    {{ _(' This changing scenario, along the ongoing efforts by stakeholders and
    communities to develop a new governance plan, underscores the need for
    enhanced spatial knowledge of the area by combining institutional data with
    the local community expertise. ') }}
  </p>

  <h2>{{ _('How was the Sketch Mapping organized?') }}</h2>

  <p>
    {{ _('Community mapping was conducted with both local adults and school
    children aged 11 to 14, who were instructed to jointly work on Sketch Maps
    in small groups. The mapping session with A3 (large scale) and A0 (small
    scale) Sketch Maps took place on the ﬁeld as well as in the classroom.
    Participants could draw landmarks and identify them as “cultural-natural
    places” (e.g. monuments, archaeological sites, birdwatching sites),
    “problematic places” (e.g. areas littered with garbage, ﬂood-prone areas),
    and “special places” with a strong subjective value (e.g. a place for
    picnicking with family, the spot where the mapper kissed for the ﬁrst time)
    <a href="#3">[3]</a>.') }}

  <h2>{{ _('How were the Sketch Maps analysed?') }}</h2>
  <p>
    {{ _('As a ﬁrst step, the geodata from the digitalized Sketch Maps was
    manually cleaned, corrected and enhanced. Then, the collected markings of
    landmarks were uploaded to the Google My Maps platform for a quicker and
    better visualization of the collected data during the mapping session in the
    classroom.') }}
  </p>
  <p>
    {{ _(' As a further step, the Heatmap Plugin in QGIS was used to perform a
    density analysis on the point layers, resulting in heatmaps that visualize
    the intensity of a phenomenon in an area based on the density of points.
    Multiple heatmaps were created to map the density areas of the selected
    landmarks, which can later be used to analyze the cultural and social
    aspects of the area <a href="#4">[4]</a>.') }}
  </p>

  <h2>{{ _('Results and Impact') }}</h2>
  <p>
    {{ _('The VGI data collected with the Sketch Map Tool sessions is to be
    merged with institutional data (e. g. land use maps, census data, maps of
    cultural sites) into a GIS platform, creating a web map that can be used to
    develop new cultural and touristic initiatives as well as a better
    governance of the problematic areas.') }}

  <h2>{{ _('Lesson learnt') }}</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      {{ _('Adult mappers demonstrated greater skills in orienting themselves on
      the map and geolocating landmarks, while the younger participants had more
      difficulties in orienting themselves in space, but identiﬁed more
      unconventional, subjectively relevant landmarks, showing interest in
      different areas and characteristics of the landscape.') }}

    <li>
      {{ _('Community mapping clearly showed its potential to highlight some

      subjective value.') }}

      {{ _('Many community mappers can orientate themselves more easily on a
      satellite map than on the OSM base maps. Since the Sketch Map Tool 1.0 was
      used, which only supported OSM as base map, satellite maps were used along
      OSM-based Sketch Maps to help with the orientation. Sketch Map Tool 2.0.
      now allows to integrate satellite imagery directly in the base maps.') }}
