            As the current version of the Sketch Map Tool has only been released very recently,
            problems
            might still occur during different steps of the process. We are sorry if this causes any
            inconvenience for you! We strive to continuously improve the product, so kindly inform
            us about the technical issues via <a

                            participatory mapping, please have a look at the results of the Map
                            Quality Check to ensure that participants can orientate properly on the

                        <li>
                            The analyses are focused on the landmark density, the
                            up-to-dateness of amenities and streets, as well as the
                            saturation of amenity and the road network mapping. You can learn more

                                href="https://www.missingmaps.org/">Missing Maps project</a> to
                            improve the OSM data before using the Sketch Map Tool. For example, you

                    At the moment the Sketch Map Tool detects red, blue, green, yellow, turquoise
                    and pink markings. Red and blue markings work best in most cases. The detection
                    works best if the marked areas are filled out entirely.<br>
                    Please make sure not to accidentally mark the globes on the edge as they are
                    needed to improve the automatic map detection.

                    <li>
                        If you have many participants or you want participants to provide a lot of
                        different information, it is recommended to use individual Sketch Maps for
                        each purpose/topic or per participant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prepare the same set of pens for all participants/groups for better
                        comparison of the results.

                    <li>
                        Inform all participants that markings should be filled out entirely and
                        should not cover the globes on the edge of the maps.

                        If different colours are used for specific topics it is possible to let
                        participants include a legend for the meaning of each colour outside the
                        map extent. However, the tool currently does not use this information.
                        This needs to be done manually in the subsequent analysis process in
                        your Geographic Information System software.

                    You can load the vector data file into your GIS software. The layers have
                    different attributes (check attribute table) which correspond to the different
                    colours and file names of the uploads. You can also open the GeoTIFF file for
                    validating the colour-detection of the markings. The GeoTIFF output files consist
                    of georeferenced images for each of your uploaded Sketch Maps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you open the files in QGIS, it should look similar to this example and show
                    all the markings of your Sketch Map(s).

                        In case some of the sketches have not been digitized correctly, you can use
                        the GeoTIFF file to manually create/adjust the polygon layers.

        <details>
            <summary>What are OSM data?</summary>
            <article>
                OpenStreetMap data are freely accessible geodata. You can find out more about it <a
                    href="https://wiki.osm.org" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <summary>What are the quality levels for OSM data used in the tool?</summary>
            <article>
                The OSM data are classified with a traffic light system. Green stands for good
                suitability of the data, yellow for possible problems when carrying out a Sketch
                Maps
                study with OSM based Sketch Maps, and red for probable problems. Recommendations
                are
                also given on what to consider based on the results.

            <summary>Which analyses are performed and why?</summary>
            <article>
                You can read more about the analyses included in the Sketch Map Tool in <a
                    href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10030130" target="_blank">this

            <summary>Why is it important to analyse the suitability of OSM data before creating a
                Sketch Map?
            </summary>
            <article>
                OSM data are used for the creation of the Sketch Maps. If the OSM data in a study
                area
                are lacking some important features, they are missing on the maps as well. Thus, the
                quality of the OSM data is directly related to the quality of the Sketch Maps. The
                features might be relevant for participants to orientate on the map.

            <summary>For which research questions can the Sketch Map Tool be used?</summary>
            <article>
                The Sketch Map Tool has been primarily developed for research questions related to
                floodings. But as the quality indicators used like the density of landmarks,
                currentness of the data and data completeness are also important
                in other use cases, you can also use it to investigate a completely different
                research question, as long as you check that it fits your purpose.

            <summary>How does mapping work with the Sketch Map Tool?</summary>
            <article>
                The local population can for example draw flooded areas such as streets, parks, etc.
                on the printed Sketch Maps. The larger paper formats also allow to hold group
                discussions about flooded areas. The maps with the markings can be photographed and
                uploaded to the tool. The georeferenced TIFF and vector files can then be further
                analysed or used.

            <summary>How large can my study area be?</summary>
            <article>
                So far the Sketch Map Tool has only been tested on neighbourhood or city level.
                The max. size of the study area is limited by the selection tool.

            <summary>Why are there a QR code and globes on the Sketch Maps?</summary>
            <article>
                The QR code is required for georeferencing. The globes support the detection of the
                map in your uploaded images. This is why it is important to have them on the Sketch
                Maps.

            <summary>Can I access my results at a later point of time?</summary>
            <article>
                No, the results should always be downloaded directly after using the tool. If you
                forgot to download the files, you can simply upload and process the files again.

            <summary>What do I have to pay attention to in the field?</summary>
            <article>
                Please make sure you do not accidentally mark the globes at the edge as they are
                needed to improve the automatic map detection. But if someone accidentally marked
                the globes, it is still possible to upload the Sketch Maps. Use thicker felt tip
                pens with intense colours. Red and blue markings are best detected in most cases.
                Prepare the same set of pens for all interviewers. Add a number on the Sketch Maps
                and save this number in the questionnaire as well, if you use one. An overview of
                each step with recommendations can be found <a href="#step-by-step">here</a>.

            </summary>
            <article>
                The images need to be in .jpg or .png format. All files together may not be larger
                than 500&nbsp;MB.
                The georeferencing works best if you scan the marked Sketch Maps with a resolution
                of
                300 dpi. The photos must be taken from above in a 180-degree angle (parallel above
                the Sketch Maps) to produce the best result.

            <summary>How do I check if the georeferencing is correct?</summary>
            <article>
                You can open the TIFF file in a geographic information system (GIS), such as ArcGIS
                or QGIS, to check this. If you load the file there and insert a basemap (for example
                the OSM basemap) you can see if the georeferencing has worked. The Sketch Maps
                should
                match the base map.

            <summary>Why does my generated TIFF file look strange?</summary>
            <article>
                Please first try to open the file in a geographic information system (GIS) such as
                ArcGIS or QGIS. The georeferencing may have worked even if the TIFF file does not
                look right. If it is still incorrect in the GIS, the map could not be properly
                detected by the tool on the photo for which there are various possible reasons. For
                example, the photo may have been taken from the wrong angle or the globes may have
                been painted over.
