                        Sketch Maps and identify marked objects within them.
                        Through supervised learning on extensive datasets of labeled images, these models acquire the ability to distinguish
                        markings from the background of Sketch Maps by analyzing patterns and features.
                        This enables them to accurately detect and differentiate markings. This predictive capability allows the models to
                        generalize their understanding and accurately identify markings in new and unseen Sketch Maps.
                        The Sketch Map Tool also incorporates conventional Computer Vision techniques to precisely position the Sketch Map
                        within real-world coordinates.
