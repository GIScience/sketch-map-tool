                        Select your area of interest either by zooming into the map preview or with
                        the

                        Choose from different paper formats and a suitable page orientation. The
                        dashed red line represents the boundaries of your area of interest, which
                        will
                        be printed on the Sketch Map.

                        The generated Sketch Map uses a base map layer of OpenStreetMap (OSM). The
                        Map
                        Quality Check helps to evaluate the fitness of the area of interest for the
                        purpose of participatory mapping based on a quality analysis of the
                        OpenStreetMap data with the HeiGIT
                        <a href="https://oqt.ohsome.org">ohsome quality analyst - OQT</a>. The
                        fitness
                        report can be downloaded as PDF file by clicking on the blue button. It
                        includes
                        an evaluation of the suitability of the local OSM data and recommendations
                        for
                        the subsequent field data collection.

                            Before you use these OSM based maps of your area of interest for
                            participatory mapping, please have a look at the analysis of the Map
                            Quality Check to ensure that participants can orientate properly on the
                            paper maps.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The analyses are focused on the Point of Interest (POI) density, the
                            last-edit of amenities and streets, the used sources, as well as the
                            saturation of amenity and the road network mapping. You can learn more
                            about the analysis and each indicator in the generated PDF report.

                    At the moment the Sketch Map Tool detects red, blue and black markings. The tool
                    does not differentiate between blue and black marking and combines these to one
                    output result. The detection works best if the marked areas are filled out
                    entirely. The tool cannot detect overlapping markings.

                        The
