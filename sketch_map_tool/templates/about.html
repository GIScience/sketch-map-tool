        <h1>The Tool</h1>
        <p>
            The Sketch Map Tool is an easy-to-use tool for offline collection, digitization and
            georeferencing of spatial field data. The tool facilitates participatory mapping, a
            process designed to integrate local knowledge in disaster risk management and
            communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sketch Map Tool is an open-source web application with several functions, including
            the creation of paper maps of an area of interest, the uploading of pictures of the
            marked maps, and the downloading of the results in various geodata formats. The files
            can then be used for further analysis in a Geographic Information System software. In
            addition, based on a quality analysis of the OpenStreetMap base map data through the
            HeiGIT ohsome dashboard, the tool can evaluate how well-suited an area is for
            participatory mapping.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tool is designed to simplify the collection and analysis of local spatial knowledge
            for the sake of engaging non-experts in these processes. Thus, for example, it can be
            used by local stakeholders to gather information about previous flood events in a
            specific area for the purpose of conducting a risk assessment, designing risk reduction
            measures, or communicating risks and increasing risk awareness among citizens.

        <h1>The Project</h1>
        <p>
            The Sketch Map Tool project has been developed in close cooperation between the HeiGIT
            and the GIScience Research Group from Heidelberg University. After the creation of the
            first prototype within the Waterproofing Data project, the tool has been tested by
            different organizations in Germany, Chile, Brazil, Mozambique and Madagascar in recent
            years. Thanks to the generous contribution of the German Red Cross, the Sketch Map Tool
            has been improved and extended in order to make it available for usage by the Red Cross
            Red Crescent Movement and similar organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the HeiGIT tools, the Sketch Map Tool will be tested in other settings to
            gather user feedback. Its functionalities will be further developed and adjusted to fit
            the needs of the humanitarian and development sector.
        </p>
