                Data project</a>, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. This first prototype received a
            major update in 2021
            when the user-interface was improved and the color detection (using computer vision methods) was implemented. Since
            then, the tool
            has been tested by various humanitarian organizations worldwide, including in Germany, Chile, Columbia, Brazil,
            Mozambique, Madagascar
            and Sudan in recent years. Thanks to the support of the German Red Cross and the financial contribution of the
            German Federal Foreign Office
