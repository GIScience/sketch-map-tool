    meetings to ensure resident participation throughout the process. Residents
    of flood-prone villages were contacted through the trusted network of the
    Timor-Leste Red Cross and its local branches. Community representatives from
    each village were invited to these meetings and asked to bring along
    community members who had been affected by recent floods. The selection
    process had no age restrictions and emphasized maintaining an equal ratio of
    men and women at the meetings. ') }}

    events on one map, and on a second map, they identified capacities such as
    evacuation sites and natural protection areas. ') }}
